# CTHULTHU
A C++ library for computing the eigenvalues of a matrix using the Hessenberg QR-Algorithm.

## Why?
Why create another library for this when there are already excellent ones out there, not to mention tools like Matlab? Because...
- I like linear algebra.
- I like C++.
- I was once naive enough to think eigenvalue generation was trivial. I was sorely mistaken.

## Makefile Targets:
Go to the src directory, and run either
```
make
```
or
```
make debug
```
- default: compiles all the classes
- debug: compiles classes with debugging output enabled

## Fun facts:
- The name was chosen because implementing this felt at times like fighting a giant dragon-octopus-anthropoid hybrid, i.e. CTHULTHU.
